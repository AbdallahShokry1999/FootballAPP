Football Management APP⚽
This project is a Microservices-based Football Management System that allows users to:
✅ Track teams, players, and tournaments
✅ Track player statistics
✅ Process payments for team merchandise using PayPal
✅ Send email confirmations after successful transactions
✅ Secure authentication and authorization using Spring Security & JWT

Project Architecture 🏗️
The system consists of multiple microservices:

Service Name		Port	Description
Match Service		8082	Manages matches between teams and stores results.
Player Stats Service	8083	Tracks player statistics (goals, assists, etc.).
Team Management Service	8080	Manages football teams and players.
Item Service		8085	Stores and sells team-related merchandise.
Payment Service		8084	Handles payments using PayPal & sends email confirmations.


API Gateway (Planned)			8081	Central entry point for all services.
Eureka Service Discovery (Planned)	8761	Registers & discovers microservices dynamically.
